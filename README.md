NextFerry
=========

NextFerry mobile app.

The old version of the mobile client is for Windows Phone only and is in this
repository.

The new mobile client is cross-platform html5/css and will soon be available
for Android, IOS and Windows Phone.  It is in the repository https://github.com/denised/telerik-newclient.git.

If you got here because you use the NextFerry app, thank you for visiting!

Developers: you are welcome to look around, but honestly I'd be surprised if there were any particularly reusable components here. The telerik-newclient repository
might be somewhat interesting as it is a working example of a reasonably complex
html5 app that does not use any heavy-weight frameworks.
