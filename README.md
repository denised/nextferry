nextferry
=========

Source code for client and server of NextFerry (Windows Phone app).
The client is available here:  
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/next-ferry/5ebd6e34-a046-4e37-9303-cd6b637cb822

The client is C#/Xaml while the server is Python, hosted in Google App Engine.

You are welcome to look around, but honestly I'd be surprised if there were any particularly reusable components here.
