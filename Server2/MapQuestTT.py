"""
Determine the travel times to ferry terminals from the client's current location.
"""
# The mapquest routematrix service takes a list of locations as an argument and returns a list of distances
# (and travel times) from the first location to each of the others in the list.
# So we supply the client's location as the first location, and all the terminals as the remaining.
# Some of the results will be unreasonable/uninteresting (for example if the client is in Seattle,
# it does not make sense to report the travel time to the Bainbridge terminal, since a ferry ride
# is required to get there).   We use a set of heuristics to filter out the unreasonable ones,
# and generally reduce the result to the minimal information the client needs.
